    <h2>This week's dish...</h2>
    <p>Baked Fish! Whenever I make this one at home, my two cats go bananas. I need a second chef around just to keep them from hopping on the counter for a bite! Just make sure the fish is fresh, preferably caught with your own rod! Now watch as I place the fish on a bed of spring greens...</p>
    <p>Grandpa's Notes: This is a universal like apart from Leo and Krobus!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <h4>Stardew: </h4>  
    <ul> 
        <li>Sunfish (1)</li> 
        <li>Bream (1)</li> 
        <li>Wheat Flour (1)</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>In Real Life: </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li> 
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
        <li>1 lemon</li> 
        <li>1 ½ lb white fish fillets</li> 
        <li>½ teaspoon EACH: sea salt and pepper</li> 
        <li>Minced parsley</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>  
    <h4>Stardew: </h4>  
    <ul> 
        <li>The Sunfish is a fish that can be caught in the river (in Pelican Town or Cindersap Forest) during Spring and Summer during sunny weather. It may also be caught on the Riverlands Farm, Forest Farm, or Hill-top Farm. It may also randomly be found at the Traveling Cart for 100-1,000g or in Garbage Cans during Spring and Summer.</li> 
        <li>The Bream is a fish that can be found in the river (in Pelican Town or Cindersap Forest) during all seasons after 6pm. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during any season, or at the Traveling Cart for 135-1,000g.</li> 
        <li>Wheat Flour is a cooking ingredient that can be consumed by itself. It can be purchased year round from Pierre's General Store for 100g or from JojaMart for Gold.png125g. 4-7 Wheat Flour may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least once. Players have the ability to craft wheat flour from wheat by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one wheat will make one wheat flour. Wheat placed inside will appear as Wheat Flour in the box beside the Mill the next morning.</li> 
        <li>Gather all your resources and head to your home's kitchen, where you can cook it up and enjoy it virtually!</li> 
    </ul>
    <h4>In Real Life: <a href="https://www.theendlessmeal.com/baked-fish/">Original Recipe<a></a></h4>
    <ol> 
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li> 
        <li>Melt the butter in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and let it cook for 1 minute. Zest the lemon (preferably with a Microplane) and add it to the butter.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the zested lemon and place the slices in the bottom of a baking dish. If there are extras, save them for the top of the fish. </li> 
        <li>Dry the fish with paper towels, season both sides with salt and pepper, then lay the fish on top of the lemon slices. Spoon or brush the garlic butter over the fish.</li> 
        <li>Bake the fish for 10-12 minutes, or until it flakes easily with a fork. Serve with a little parsley sprinkled over the top for color.</li> 
    </ol>
