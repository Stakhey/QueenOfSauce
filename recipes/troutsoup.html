    <h2>This week's dish...</h2> 
    <p>Trout Soup! There's something about fresh-caught trout that just gets me buzzing. Maybe it's the subtle taste of the river. At any rate, I've got a wonderful trout soup recipe to share with you today...</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2> 
    <h4>Stardew: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The Rainbow Trout is a fish that can be caught in the river (in Pelican Town and Cindersap Forest) and the mountain lake during Summer during sunny weather. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer, or at the Traveling Cart for 195-1,000g.</li>
        <li>Green Algae is an item that can be caught using a Fishing Pole during all seasons at any freshwater location, with the exception of the Farm Pond on the Standard Farm. It is also dropped from Green Slimes (10% chance), and may be produced in Slimejack, Crayfish, Snail, or Periwinkle Fish Ponds.</li>
        <li>Gather all your resources and head to your home's kitchen, where you can cook it up and enjoy it virtually!</li>

    <ul>
        <li>In a large pot, melt the butter over moderately low heat.</li>
        <li>Add the celery, the chopped scallion bulbs, and the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes, wine, water, broth, thyme, bay leaf, and salt to the pot. Bring to a boil. </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the half-and-half into the soup. Simmer until the soup starts to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the trout and the scallion tops. Remove the bay leaf from the soup.</li>
