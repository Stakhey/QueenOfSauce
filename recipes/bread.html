    <h2>This week's dish...</h2> 
    <p>Bread! Breadmaking can be a very complex form of art, but I'll make it simple for you. The most important ingredient is flour, of course. But before we create the dough we'll need to activate our yeast. They prefer warm water and little something to feed on. I use plain sugar, but honey or maple syrup will do!</p>  
    <p>Grandpa's Notes: Don't give this to Leah, she hates this! I recommend using this recipe to make <a href="../recipes/bruschetta.html">bruschetta.</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Stardew: </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>Wheat Flour (1)</li> 
    </ul>  
    <h4>In Real Life: </h4> 
    <ul> 
        <li>500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li> 
        <li>2 tsp salt</li> 
        <li>7g sachet fast-action yeast</li> 
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>  
    <h4>Stardew: </h4>
    <ol> 
        <li>Wheat Flour is a cooking ingredient that can be consumed by itself. It can be purchased year round from Pierre's General Store for 100g or from JojaMart for Gold.png125g. 4-7 Wheat Flour may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least once. Players have the ability to craft wheat flour from wheat by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one wheat will make one wheat flour. Wheat placed inside will appear as Wheat Flour in the box beside the Mill the next morning.</li> 
        <li>Gather all your resources and head to your home's kitchen, where you can cook it up and enjoy it virtually!</li>

    <h4>In Real Life: <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-white-bread">Original Recipe<a></a></h4>  
    <ol> 
        <li>Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.</li> 
        <li>Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.</li> 
        <li>Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.</li> 
        <li>Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.        </li> 
        <li>Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.</li> 
        <li>Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</li> 
        <li>Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.</li> 
        <li>Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
