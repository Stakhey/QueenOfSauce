    <h2>This week's dish...</h2> 
    <p>Blackberry Cobbler! This one always reminds me of Stardew Valley. There's a few days in fall where the valley is overflowing with the most delicious blackberries I've ever tasted. If you can get your hands on some, I'd highly recommend them for this simple cobbler.</p>  
    <p>Grandpa's Notes: Abigail loves this!</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2> 
    <h4>Stardew: </h4> 
    <ol> 
        <li>The Blackberry is a Fruit found via Foraging throughout Stardew Valley. It can be found on the ground during Fall and on bushes during Blackberry Season (Fall 8-11). </li> 
        <li>Sugar is a cooking ingredient that can be used in a variety of recipes. It can be purchased year round from Pierre's General Store for 100g or from JojaMart for 125g. 4-7 Sugar may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least once. Players have the ability to craft Sugar from Beets by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one Beet will make three Sugar. Beets placed inside will appear as Sugar in the box beside the Mill the next morning.<li>
        <li>Players have the ability to craft wheat flour from wheat by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one wheat will make one wheat flour. Wheat placed inside will appear as Wheat Flour in the box beside the Mill the next morning.</li> 
        <li>Gather all your resources and head to your home's kitchen, where you can cook it up and enjoy it virtually!</li>

    <ol> 
        <li>Make the berry mixture: Put the blackberries, sugar, lemon zest and juice, cinnamon and cornstarch in a 9x9 baking dish. Stir to combine everything and make sure that the berries are all evenly coated with sugar.Let sit for 30 minutes for the berries to macerate so that the sugar dissolves and the berries release their juices.</li> 
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F</li> 
        <li>Vigorously whisk together the flour, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Cut the butter into the flour mixture with your fingers or a fork until the topping mixture resembles coarse crumbs.Make a well in the center and stir in the milk and beaten egg until the dough is just moistened.</li> 
        <li>Scoop up the dough in large spoonfuls, and drop over the berries in the baking dish like cobblestones.</li> 
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes at 350°F, or until the berry mixture is bubbly and the topping is nicely browned. Great served with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</li> 
    </ol>
