    <h2>This week's dish...</h2> 
    <p>	Bruschetta! It's a wonderfully simple appetizer that really showcases the quality of the ingredients. You'll need bread, tomato, and oil. First, you'll need to grill the bread. Slice the tomato and place onto the grilled bread. Then drizzle with oil and serve. I told you it was simple!</p>  
    <p>Grandpa's Notes: Not sure how, but if you use a sewing machine you can make a shirt and a tie using this!</p>
