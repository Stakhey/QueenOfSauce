    <h2>This week's dish...</h2> 
    <p>	Bruschetta! It's a wonderfully simple appetizer that really showcases the quality of the ingredients. You'll need bread, tomato, and oil. First, you'll need to grill the bread. Slice the tomato and place onto the grilled bread. Then drizzle with oil and serve. I told you it was simple!</p>  
    <p>Grandpa's Notes: Not sure how, but if you use a sewing machine you can make a shirt and a tie using this!</p>

    <h4>Stardew: </h4>
    <ol> 
        <li>In Real Life: Here is a suitable recipe for making <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/bruschetta_with_tomato_and_basil/">bruschetta<a> in real life!</li>
        <li>Bread is a cooked dish, which can be made using wheat flour. It is also sold every day byu Gus in the Stardrop Saloon for 120g.</li>
        <li>Oil is a cooking ingredient made from the Oil Maker. It can also be obtained from Pierre's General Store for 200g. 2-4 Oil may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least once.</li> 
        <li>The Tomato is a vegetable crop that grows from Tomato Seeds after 11 days in the Summer.</li> 
        <li>Gather all your resources and head to your home's kitchen, where you can cook it up and enjoy it virtually!</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>In Real Life: </h4> 
    <ol> 
        <li>Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).</li>  
        <li>Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put scored tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.</li>  
        <li>Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife. Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.</li> 
        <li>Preheat the oven to 230°C with a rack in the top slot of the oven.</li>  
        <li>Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.</li>
        <li>Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.</li>  
        <li>Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan. The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.</li> 
        <li>When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.</li>
        <li>Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes). Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.</li>
